I am working with www.w3schools.com to help me understand GitHub. I think it's easy and will learn it after work daily for a few days, then keep practicing until it becomes second nature.
It's so great learning to work with git even better than I did before. 
Totally added two branches unintentionally: w3goodies and then hello-world-images.
